# Project Eatgo

Eatgo is a restaurant information website that collects and displays highly rated restaurants in Australia.

The project is now available at https://eatgo.herokuapp.com/

<br />

## Project Summary

Currently, the website covers restaurants in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. Users can search for restaurants by city name and food category (e.g. Thai, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) and view the results on a dedicated page.

By clicking on a restaurant, users can access detailed information about the restaurant, including a photo, name, description, address, Google Review score, and current local weather. Users can also create and log into their own accounts to claim coupon codes. Administrators are able to create and edit restaurants, ensuring that the information is up-to-date and accurate.

## Technologies Used:
